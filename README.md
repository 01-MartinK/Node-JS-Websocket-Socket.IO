# Node-JS-Websocket-Socket.IO
<h2>Project</h2>
Simple project introducing websockets using socket.io.
Also it has mongodb example afterwards.

To see the different examples just look at the git history and take what you need

<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>Firstly you need to have <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community">mongodb</a> installed and running.</p>
<p>After that open the project in the server directory run <code>npm install</code> after that just run it.<code>node index.js</code></p>
